We create a new role in the PostgreSQL system. We allow it to have ability to create new databases. A role is a user in a database world. Roles are separate from operating system users. We have created a new user without the -W option, e.g. we have not specified a password. This enables us to connect to a database with this user without password authentication. Note that this works only on localhost.

$ sudo -u postgres createdb testdb -O janbodnar
The createdb command creates a new PostgreSQL database with the owner janbodnar.
