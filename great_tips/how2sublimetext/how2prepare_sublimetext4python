To limit this configuration to Ruby files, first open up a Ruby file in the editor, 
and then go to Preferences -> Settings -> More -> Syntax Specific -> User. 
This should open a settings window named Ruby.sublime-settings

Save these settings:

{
  "tab_size": 2,
  "translate_tabs_to_spaces": true
}
