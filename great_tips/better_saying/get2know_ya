"Get To Know Ya"

They be tryin' to bring you flowers
you prefer your roses blue
brothers try to get in your trousers
others was tryin' to get into you
I was just tryin' to get with you honest
Thats why them boys be scared of you
you never let them get past pajamas
oh...when you find the time
how can I get to know ya?

Yo' name, number...game
tell me anything
I gotta get to know ya
Yo' way, the words you'd sya
when you want I'll be here baby
Longin' to know ya

I know that you'll never see me
I know that
I'm not your style
I know that
You don't need me
But you do
you drive my dreams wild
Lady I got t know ya

Name, number..game
tell me anything
I gotta get to know ya
When you want Im right here baby
Longin to know ya
Feel me, know ya know ya

Ha ha know ya ooohhh
