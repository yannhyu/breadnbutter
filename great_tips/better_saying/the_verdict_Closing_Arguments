                         You know, so much of the time we're 
                         lost. We say, 'Please, God, tell us 
                         what is right. Tell us what's true. 
                         There is no justice. The rich win, 
                         the poor are powerless...' We become 
                         tired of hearing people lie. After a 
                         time we become dead. A little dead. 
                         We start thinking of ourselves as 
                         victims.
                              (pause)
                         And we become victims.
                              (pause)
                         And we become weak... and doubt 
                         ourselves, and doubt our 
                         institutions... and doubt our 
                         beliefs... we say for example, 'The 
                         law is a sham... there is no law... 
                         I was a fool for having believed 
                         there was.'
                              (beat)
                         But today you are the law. You are 
                         the law... And not some book and not 
                         the lawyers, or the marble statues 
                         and the trappings of the court... 
                         all that they are is symbols.
                              (beat)
                         Of our desire to be just...
                              (beat)
                         All that they are, in effect, is a 
                         prayer...
                              (beat)
                         ...a fervent, and a frightened prayer.

                         In my religion we say, 'Act as if 
                         you had faith, and faith will be 
                         given to you.'
                              (beat)
                         If... If we would have faith in 
                         justice, we must only believe in 
                         ourselves.
                              (beat)
                         And act with justice.
                              (beat)
                         And I believe that there is justice 
                         in our hearts.
                              (beat)
                         Thank you.
