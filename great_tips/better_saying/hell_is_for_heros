Hell Is for Heroes [1962]

Genre: Drama, War   
Don Siegel brings his tough worldview and crisp, no-nonsense direction to this quintessential World War II drama of an undermanned American platoon in France holding off a German advance through sheer bluff and bravery. Steve McQueen is curt and surly as the insubordinate loner whose tactical skills and soldiering savvy make him indispensable to his new unit. His reputation precedes him, but commander Fess Parker is in no position to be choosy when he learns that his tired platoon will not be shipping home as rumored, but tossed into a ragged new offensive. Harry Guardino costars as the soulful Sarge; James Coburn is the slow-talking, forever-tinkering mechanic; Bobby Darin is the scavenger with a small fortune in trinkets; and Nick Adams is the Polish orphan and unit mascot. Bob Newhart makes his feature debut as a hopelessly lost typing clerk drafted into the undermanned unit and re-creates his nightclub shtick making phony phone calls near a Nazi listening post in the pillbox. Like Pork Chop Hill, this film is less a patriotic flag waver than a "war is hell" drama that frames the battle not in its tactical importance (which is negligible) but in its cost in human life. McQueen's taciturn performance as a ruthlessly effective soldier and Siegel's tough, lean direction make it a modest classic of the genre. --Sean Axmaker

Pvt. Dave Corby:
Hey, how you doin', buddy? As you can see, we eat very well around here. Hey, on the up and up, if there's anything you might need, I'm the guy to see around here. If I don't have it, I can get it for you.

Pvt. John Reese:
Beat it.

Pvt. Dave Corby:
Oh, excuse me. I didn't recognize you, General.

Monique Ouidel:
I drink to you, and to the American Army.

Pvt. John Reese:
How long ago were you drinking to the Third Reich?

Monique Ouidel:
I do not like the Germans.

Pvt. John Reese:
You don't like me, either, but you're drinking with me.

Platoon Sgt. Bill Pike:
I was kind of surprised to see you in our outfit.

Pvt. John Reese:
You and me both.

Platoon Sgt. Bill Pike:
I haven't had time to check your papers. Where'd you transfer from?

Pvt. John Reese:
The outfit I came from was a real dilly. There was a general, a major, two captains, two lieutenants, and me. There's a squad for you, buddy-o.

Platoon Sgt. Bill Pike:
Sounds like a court martial board.

Sgt. Jim Larkin:
Hey, Corby, what's the matter with you? Can't you forget about that loot? You're in a church.

Pvt. Dave Corby:
This ain't a church no more, Sergeant. And besides, even if it was, so what?

Sgt. Jim Larkin:
Well it used to be, J.J. You oughtta have respect for things that used to be.

Pvt. Dave Corby:
What are you buckin' for chaplain or something? I got respect, Sergeant. Plenty. But its not for somebody I can't see.

Capt. Roger Loomis:
Reese! Who gave the order for that attempt on the pillbox? You hear me? Who gave the order?

Pvt. John Reese:
I did, sir.

Capt. Roger Loomis:
You had orders to stay here on the ridge and hold it. You knew that! What about Kalinsky? What about the man you left in the field? And you say you gave the order, huh? Reese, you're a private, you don't give orders, you *take* them!
