Hey, dummy!
How you doing, Slim?
Where you going?
Mexico.
...

Come on out of there.
You okay?
I guess so. I don't know.
WeII, it looks kind of deep.
No scar.
Don't scratch.
It's liabIe to give you an infection.
What did I tell you?
It's not a game.
It's all a game.
-There's something I want--
-I don't want to hear it.
Listen! It's hard enough for me as it is!
The things you said before....
You might be right.
Ain't gonna mean anything
if we don't make it together.
I don't think we can make it.
I think if we ever get out of this dump,
I'll just split.
We've made it together so far.
We've come a lot of miles
but we're not close to anything.
I always thought jails made people hard.
Not you, boy. I mean, you're just not
tough enough to forget about Beynon.
I chose you, not him, you know that?
Not that it makes any difference.
We pick up or we leave it.
We leave it here, there's no other way.
No more about him.
Whatever happens...
...no more about him.
