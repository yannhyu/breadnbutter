Grimes:
Mister, you have got a lot of hard bark on you comin' down here like this. Now, you put two holes in me and I owe you.

John Russell:
Two's usually enough for most.

Grimes:
I wouldn't try anything because that Vaquero

Grimes:
is more than a fair hand. Did you bring the money?

John Russell:
Guess I brought my dirty laundry by mistake.

Grimes:
Let's see it.

Grimes:
Now what do your suppose hell is gonna look like.

John Russell:
We all gotta die, it's only a matter of when.

Jessie:
And we got him a marble headstone. It had his name on it, and underneath, we had them put, "In the Fullness of His Years." Is that all right with you?

John Russell:
I'll settle for that. I'm not on the slab.

Jessie:
Well, what do you figure yours is going to read?

John Russell:
"Shot Dead," probably.

Jessie:
Don't people take to you, Mr. Russell?

John Russell:
It only takes one who doesn't.

Doris Blake:
You're just saying that so we won't go down there.

John Russell:
They'll kill you both. That's why I'm saying it.

Mexican Bandit:
I would like at least to know his name.

Henry Mendez:
He was called John Russell.

Henry Mendez:
Hombre, which name today, which do you want?

John Russell:
Anything but bastard will do.

Braden:
Hey, what's going on?

Jessie:
I'm moving you out. I want you to take your socks, your cigar stubs, your long johns, and your nickel-plated sheriff's badge, and amble back down the hall to your own room.

Braden:
I like it here.

Jessie:
Can't quite remember how you got squatter's rights in here, anyhow. Seems to me you came by one night to ask for an extra blanket and stayed a year.

Braden:
I been working since I was ten years old, Jessie, cleaning spittoons at a dime a day. It's now thirty years later, and all I can see out the window here is a dirt road going nowhere. The only thing that changes the view is the spotted dog lifting his leg against the wall over there. Saturday nights, I haul out the town drunks. I get their 25-cent dinners and their rotgut liquor heaved up over the front of my one good shirt. I wear three pounds of iron strapped to my leg. That makes me fair game for any punk cowboy who's had one too many. No, Jess, I don't need a wife. I need out.

Jessie:
That soldier would have helped you and you know it.

John Russell:
I didn't ask for any.

Jessie:
He didn't even have a gun.

John Russell:
That's his business he don't wanna carry one.

Jessie:
It takes a lot to light a fire under you, doesn't it.

John Russell:
If it's alright with you, lady, I just didn't feel like bleeding for him. And even if it isn't alright with you.

Doris Blake:
I've heard a lot of stories about what the Indians do to white women.

Grimes:
They do the same thing to white women they do to Indian women, and they don't mind it much, red or white.

Audra Favor:
I can't imagine eating a dog and not thinking anything of it.

John Russell:
You even been hungry, lady? Not just ready for supper. Hungry enough so that your belly swells?

Audra Favor:
I wouldn't care how hungry I got. I know I wouldn't eat one of those camp dogs.

John Russell:
You'd eat it. You'd fight for the bones, too.

Audra Favor:
Have you ever eaten a dog, Mr. Russell?

John Russell:
Eaten one and lived like one.

Audra Favor:
Dear me.

Grimes:
Smoke bother you?

Audra Favor:
Would you put it out if I said it did?

Grimes:
Oh, yeah. My momma taught me to remove my hat and my cigar in the presence of a lady. Whatever else I take off depends on how lucky I get.

John Russell:
The dead are dead. You ought to bury them.

Jessie:
I'm sure that's good advice. Trouble is, Mr. Russell, I think you feel the same way about the living.

John Russell:
Glad to buy you dinner.

Jessie:
There's a lot of men who'll do that, Mr. Russell.

John Russell:
Well, I'd just as soon make it breakfast.

John Russell:
Hit something, Mendez, first the men, then the horses.

Henry Mendez:
I don't know. Just to sit here and wait to kill them?

John Russell:
If there was some other way, we'd do it.

Henry Mendez:
Maybe we can keep going and try to outrun them.

John Russell:
If you run, they're gonna catch you, they're gonna kill you. You believe that more than you believe anything.

Henry Mendez:
All right.

John Russell:
And try not to puke. You may have to lie in it for a long time.

John Russell:
You better put down that gun. You got two ways to go, put it down or use it. Even if you tie me, you're gonna be dead.

Grimes:
Throw down two saddles.

Grimes:
You're comin' with us.

Audra Favor:
No, I think I'll stay here.

Grimes:
You will be all right.

Audra Favor:
I'll be *all right* here.

Grimes:
One way or another, you're comin' with us.
