Were you working here last weekend?

No, day off.
- Did you do anything nice?

So what's . . .?
- Epiphany.

Your mama left you
with a very beautiful name.

And not much else.

You're a very pretty girl, Epiphany,
your name suits you.

Spider played them drums
like two jackrabbits fucking!

Jesus, you've got beautiful eyes!

Really.

The kind of eyes
that tell what's going on inside.

How unfortunate! - All I've got is a
belly full of hocus-pocus and . . .

  stiffs.

He got choked to death with a part of
the body meant for pissing with . . .

The future isn't what it used to be.

I'll be in town for a day or two,
let me know what else you find,

and if you need more money . . .
- No!

But if I'm not careful,
that      bucks you gave me could
buy me a seat on the electric chair.

Frightened eyes never lie.  

What the hell did your mother see in
a guy like Johnny Favorite?

I don't know. Whatever he had,
it sure stole her heart away.

To tell you the truth,
the guy was a creep.

She sure missed him.

What does a lady see in a guy
who runs around chopping up pigeons?

They say it's always the bad-asses
who make a girl's heart beat faster.

Did she ever say anything about him?

Just two things.
- What?

That Johnny Favorite was as close to
true evil as she ever wanted to come.

What else?

That he was a terrific lover.

I just...
don't want you to lose
your good opinion of me.
You know, Lucius...
I hold you in awful high regard.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

to reach your manhood...
sometimes you gotta say goodbye
to the things you know...
and hello to the things you don't.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing,
there is a field. I'll meet you there.

When the soul lies down in that grass,
the world is too full to talk about.
Ideas, language, even the phrase "each other" doesn't make any sense.
