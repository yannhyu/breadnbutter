AFI's 100 GREATEST AMERICAN MOVIES OF ALL TIME

The very first edition of AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies is a list of the 100 greatest American films of all time.

In 1998, AFI invited more than 1,500 leaders from across the American film community – screenwriters, directors, actors, producers, cinematographers, editors, executives, film historians and critics among them – to choose from a list of 400 nominated films compiled by AFI and select the 100 greatest American movies.

The AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies CBS television special originally aired on June 16, 1998.

The updated 10th anniversary edition to this list is here.
