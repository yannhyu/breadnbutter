Conway's Game of Life in Python

-Overpopulation: if a living cell is surrounded by more than three living cells, it dies.
-Stasis: if a living cell is surrounded by two or three living cells, it survives.
-Underpopulation: if a living cell is surrounded by fewer than two living cells, it dies.
-Reproduction: if a dead cell is surrounded by exactly three cells, it becomes a live cell.
By enforcing these rules in sequential steps, beautiful and unexpected patterns can appear.
