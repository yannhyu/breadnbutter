redirect and append both stdout and stderr to a file with Bash

cmd >>file.txt 2>&1
Bash executes the redirects from left to right as follows:

>>file.txt: Open file.txt in append mode and redirect stdout there.
2>&1: Redirect stderr to "where stdout is currently going". In this case, that is a file opened in append mode. In other words, the &1 reuses the file descriptor which stdout currently uses.
