# step_01_bootstraping.py

# Great idea: we can learn charateristics of 
# a sample of population by re-sampling of
# the same sample itself
# Learn more information about our sampling
# without new samples

# Re-sample with replacement from that same
# sample you have taken
# Sometimes sample is expensive to get: 
#    think drug tests
#    drug study on effects

# Bootstraping is used when obtaining new
# samples is expensive
